# MNIST_NN_Handwritten_DigitsClassification_Pytorch
In this project, a regular Neural Network is used to classify digits from 0 - 9. Dataset is plit into 3000 for training, 3000 for validation, and 1000 for validation. An accuracy of 95% on the testing dataset was achieved. Pytorch was used. Dataset was flattened, converted to tensors, and normalized. Learning rate was set to 0.003 and ADAM optimiser also was used.
